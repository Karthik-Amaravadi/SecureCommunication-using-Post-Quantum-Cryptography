Abstract

   Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms
   provide confidentiality and integrity of data.  The extensive use of
   AEAD algorithms in various high-level applications has caused the
   need for AEAD algorithms with additional properties and motivated
   research in the area.  This document gives definitions for the most
   common of those properties intending to improve consistency in the
   field.

1.  Introduction

   An Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm is
   an extension of authenticated encryption, which provides
   confidentiality for the plaintext to be encrypted and integrity for
   the plaintext and some Associated Data (sometimes called Header).
   AEAD algorithms are used in numerous applications and have become an
   important field in cryptographic research.

1.1.  Background

   AEAD algorithms are formally defined in [RFC5116].  The main benefit
   of AEAD algorithms is that they provide both data confidentiality and
   data integrity and have a simple unified interface.

   The importance of the AEAD algorithms is mainly explained by their
   exploitation simplicity: they have a unified interface, easy-to-
   understand security guarantees, and are much easier to implement
   properly than MAC and encryption schemes separately.  Therefore,
   their embedding into high-level schemes and protocols is highly
   transparent since, for example, there is no need for additional key
   derivation procedures.  Apart from that, when using the AEAD
   algorithm, it is possible to reduce the key and state sizes and
   improve the data processing speed.  For instance, such algorithms are
   mandatory for TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], IPsec ESP [RFC4303] [RFC8221], and
   QUIC [RFC9000].  Hence, the research and standardization efforts in
   the field are extremely active.  Most AEAD algorithms usually come
   with security guarantees, formal proofs, usage guidelines, and
   reference implementations.

   Even though providing core properties of AEAD algorithms is enough
   for use in many applications, some environments require other unusual
   cryptographic properties, which commonly require additional analysis
   and research.  With the growing number of such properties and
   research papers, misunderstanding and confusion inevitably appear.
   Some properties might be understood in different ways, for some only
   non-trivial formal security notions are provided, others require
   modification or extension of the standard AEAD interface to support
   additional functionality.  Therefore, the risk of misuse of AEAD
   algorithms increases which can lead to security issues.

1.2.  Scope

   In the following document, we provide a short overview of the most
   common properties of AEAD algorithms, by giving high-level
   definitions of these properties in Section 3.  The document aims to
   improve clarity and establish a common language in the field.

3.  AEAD properties

3.1.  Security properties

3.1.1.  Confidentiality

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm guarantees that data is available only
   to those authorized to obtain it.  That property is required for the
   AEAD algorithm to be called secure.

   Synonyms.  Privacy.

   Further reading.  [R2002], [BN2000]

3.1.2.  Data integrity

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm guarantees that data has not been
   changed or forged by those who are not authorized to.  That property
   is required for the AEAD algorithm to be called secure.

   Synonyms.  Message authentication.

   Further reading.  [R2002], [BN2000]

3.1.3.  Blockwise security

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm provides security even if an adversary
   can adaptively choose the next block of the plaintext (ciphertext)
   depending on already computed blocks of the ciphertext (plaintext)
   during an encryption (decryption) operation.

   Further reading.  [JMV2002], [FJMV2004]

3.1.4.  Key Dependent Messages (KDM) security

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm provides security even when key-
   dependent plaintexts are encrypted.

   Notes.  KDM-security is achievable only if nonces are chosen randomly
   and associated data is key-independent.

   Further reading.  [BK2011]

3.1.5.  Key commitment

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm guarantees that it is difficult to
   find a tuple of the nonce, associated data, and ciphertext such that
   it can be decrypted correctly with more than one key.

   Synonyms.  Key-robustness, key collision resistance.

   Further reading.  [FOR17], [LGR21], [GLR17]

3.1.6.  Leakage resistance

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm provides security even if some
   additional information about computations of an encryption (and
   possibly decryption) operation is obtained via side-channel leakages.

   Further reading.  [GPPS19], [B20]

3.1.7.  Multi-user security

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm security level degrades sublinearly in
   the number of users.  Here the level of security is understood in the
   sense of Authenticated Encryption Advantage (AEA) as given in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-aead-limits].

   Further reading.  [BT16]

3.1.8.  Nonce misuse

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm provides security (resilience or
   resistance) even if an adversary can repeat nonces in its encryption
   queries.

3.1.8.1.  Nonce misuse resilience

   Definition.  Security is provided only for messages encrypted with
   unique nonces.

3.1.8.2.  Nonce misuse resistance

   Definition.  Security is provided for all messages.

   Further reading.  [RS06]

3.1.9.  Reforgeability resilience

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm guarantees that once a successful
   forgery for the algorithm has been found, it is still hard to find
   any subsequent forgery.

   Further reading.  [BC09], [FLLW17]

3.1.10.  Release of unverified plaintext (RUP) security

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm provides security even if the
   plaintext is released for every ciphertext, including those with
   failed integrity verification.

   Further reading.  [A14]

3.2.  Implementation properties

3.2.1.  Inverse-free

   Definition.  A block cipher-based AEAD algorithm can be securely
   implemented without evaluating the block cipher inverse.

3.2.2.  Lightweight

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm can be efficiently and securely
   implemented on resource-constrained devices.  In particular, it meets
   the criteria required in the NIST Lightweight Cryptography
   competition [MBTM17].

   Further reading.  [MBTM17]

3.2.3.  Online

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm encryption (decryption) operation can
   be implemented with a constant memory and a single one-direction pass
   over the plaintext (ciphertext), writing out the result during that
   pass.

3.2.4.  Parallelizable

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm can fully exploit the parallel
   computation infrastructure.

   Further reading.  [C20]

3.2.5.  Single pass

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm encryption (decryption) operation can
   be implemented with a single pass over the plaintext (ciphertext).

3.2.6.  Static Associated Data

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm allows pre-computation for static (or
   repeating) associated data so that static AD doesn't significantly
   contribute to the computational cost of encryption.

3.2.7.  ZK-friendly

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm operates on binary and prime fields
   with a low number of non-linear operations (often called
   multiplicative complexity).  Thus, it allows efficient implementation
   using a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing zk-SNARKs
   circuits.

   Synonyms.  ZK-focused, Arithmetization-oriented, Low Multiplicative
   Complexity

   Further reading.  [DGGK21]

3.3.  Additional functionality properties

3.3.1.  Incremental

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm allows encrypting a message, which
   only partly differs from some other previously encrypted message,
   faster than processing it from scratch.

   Further reading.  [SY16], [BKY02]

3.3.2.  Nonce-hiding

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm decryption operation doesn't need the
   nonce value to perform the decryption.  Thus, the algorithm provides
   privacy for the nonce value.

   Further reading.  [BNT19]

Internet-Draft        Properties of AEAD algorithms        December 2022


3.3.3.  Remotely-keyed

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm can be securely implemented with most
   of the operations in encryption/decryption performed by an insecure
   (i.e., it leaks all intermediate values) device, which has no access
   to the key, while another secure device performs operations involving
   the key.

   Further reading.  [BFN98], [DA03]

3.3.4.  Robust

   Definition.  An AEAD algorithm allows the user to choose an arbitrary
   value l >= 0 for every plaintext and then encrypts it into a
   ciphertext, which is l bits longer.

   Further reading.  [HKR2015]

4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines the properties of AEAD algorithms.  However,
   the document does not describe any concrete mechanisms providing
   these properties, neither it describes how to achieve them.  In fact,
   one can claim that an AEAD algorithm provides any of the defined
   properties only if its analysis in the relevant models was carried
   out.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
